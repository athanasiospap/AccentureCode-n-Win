# Code & Win Challenge «My Plan Rocks»
## Accenture Meets AUTh - 21 November 2017
 
During the first day of the [event](https://dasta.auth.gr/cmsitem.aspx?sid=2&id=778), organized by Accenture in cooperation with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, we participated in the hackathon called «My Plan Rocks». Our team won the 1st place.

## «My Plan Rocks» Description 
### The case
Sophia is a new team leader with a new task. She is quite nervous and is short in time. She has two people in her team and is looking for a tool that can help her create a plan. Can you help her?

### Application
The application will allow the user to insert task parameters, calculate the delivery date and represent visually the detailed duration of the task.
The implementation consists of the following three parts which progressively increase in difficulty:
+ Record & Store Data
+ Calculate Delivery Date
+ Visual Representation

In order to complete that task, for the first part we used an HTML form with all the necessary JS and jQuery needed to make it more fancy and the back-end is implemented with Django.
For the second part, we made a script in Python, calculating exactly the delivery date, without taking into account the weekends and the public holidays, using the Holiday API.
